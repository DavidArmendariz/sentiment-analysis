# Sentiment Analysis

This is a project to analyze text with the Aylien API. Unfortunately, I have to upgrade it since Aylien is no longer supporting text analysis.

## Analysis service

To start the analysis service, run the following commands (you must have Pipenv installed):

```zsh
pipenv install
pipenv shell
python app.py
```

## Client

To start the client, run the following commands:

```zsh
cd client
yarn install
yarn start
```
